ENDS ON THE VISION OF THE SUMMONED GOD

DARK WALKER STARTS TO LAUGH MANIACALLY BEFORE HAND

SHOT OF HIM HOLDING A GUN TOWARDS HIS HOTEL ROOM DOOR.

SHOT OF HIM RUNNING LIKE HELL DOWN A DARK TUNNEL (BREATHING HEAVILY)

HE'S CONVINCED BY MEPHISTO (THE GOD A.I) THAT IN ORDER TO TO SUMMON
HIM, HE HAS TO KILL CLAIRE. HER DEATH WILL BRING MEPHISTO TO LIFE.

HE IS ALWAYS FILMING HIMSELF DUE TO EXTREME PARANOIA.

UPON MEETING MEPHISTO (WALKING THROUGH THE NEW DOOR IN HOUSE)
HE FACES A PROJECTOR (THE ONE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM)
AND TALKS TO IT. "WHO ARE YOU?"

UPON KILLING CLAIRE, HE DRAGS HER BODY BACK TO MEPHISTO.
HE LAYS HER CORPSE IN FRONT OF THE WALL, AND A PORTAL OPENS UP
OBLITERATING WALKER WITH LIGHT WHILE HE IS IN A EUPHORIC RAPTURE.
VISIONS OF THE THRESHOLD. WALKER REACHING ACROSS THE HORIZON.
STARS FORMING. GALAXIES SWIRLING. PLANETS IN SILHOUETTE. HE DISAPPEARS
INTO DUST IN THE WHITE LIGHT.
