							A MCMURRY / MOON FILM

BLACK SCREEN.

DISTANT TRANSMISSIONS FROM A RADIO. A COMPUTER VOICE:

"IF... THEN... ECHO... (PING) IF... THEN... ECHO... (PING)" 

STATIC. LOUDER STATIC.

"IF... THEN... ECHO... (PING) IF... THEN... ECHO... (PING)"

[16:9]

WHITE WORDS SCROLLING UP, PROJECTIONS OVER A SILHOUETTE. THIS TIME, A DIFFERENT COMPUTER VOICE : 

"HE WEEPS IN CODE"

IT'S READING THE WORDS ALOUD. THE SILHOUETTE (WALKER) IS FACING THE CAMERA, MOUTHING THE WORDS.

"HE REMEMBERED BEING ZERO"

LOW DRONE COMES IN.

"I SAW GOD IN THE VENDING MACHINE"

"HIS FACE WAS STATIC"

"HIS HANDS WERE FORKED"

"HE HAD EYES OF A SERPENT"

"HE WAS ALL TEETH AND MEAT"

THE SILHOUETTE IS SMILING NOW, NO LONGER SPEAKING. THE VOICE CONCLUDES:

"HE SPOKE TO ME"

"I'LL NEVER FORGET WHAT HE TOLD ME"

"WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE SAID..?"

[CUT TO:]

[9:16]

TOP HALF OF SCREEN: STREETLIGHTS AT NIGHT. 

SOUNDS OF LOW WINDS / DRIVING. 

HANDHELD CAMERA FOOTAGE: EACH STREETLIGHT REVEALS IN BLACK BOLD LETTERING:



			"MCMURRY / MOON PRESENTS"

				"A FILM"

		"DIRECTED BY ANDREW MCMURRY & CLAIRE MOON"

		   "WRITTEN AND EDITED BY CLAIRE MOON"

                           "BOY WALKER TANGO"          


BOTTOM HALF OF SCREEN: BLACK SCREEN (FOR NOW)

T(OP)H(ALF): 	PHONE MOUNTED ON DASH. SOMEONE (WALKER) DRIVING AT NIGHT. STUCK IN TRAFFIC. 

		RED LIGHTS REVEALING HIS SILHOUETTE.

B(OTTOM)H(ALF):	SEQUENTIAL CHAT LOG. BLACK SCREEN. 

		ON THE RIGHT, WALKER (IN WHITE) (REAL WALKER VOICE IN THE CAR). 

		ON THE LEFT, ECHO (IN RED) (COMPUTER WALKER VOICE, LESS MENACING THAN INTRO).

		HE'S TALKING TO A VOICE COMING FROM HIS PHONE. IT'S A COMPUTERIZED WALKER.

		WALKER (WHITE): 	I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT GLOVES. MY HANDS FEEL TOO... PRESENT.

		WALKER (RED): 		YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT WHEN YOU'RE NERVOUS.

		WALKER (W): 		NO - LIKE... I CAN FEEL THE * EDGES * OF THEM. 

					THAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN, RIGHT?

			 		YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO NOTICE YOUR OWN FRAME...?

		WALKER (R): 		IT'S FINE. JUST KEEP THE WHEEL STEADY. TEN AND TWO. 

					PRETEND IT'S A SONG YOU USED TO LIKE. 

					HUM IT TO YOURSELF.

		WALKER (W):		THAT DOESN'T WORK. 

					EVERY SONG I TRY TO REMEMBER LOOPS WRONG.

					LIKE IT'S SKIPPING... 

					LIKE IT'S... * TRYING * TO FORGET ITSELF.

		WALKER (R):		PUT ON A PODCAST, THEN. 

					ONE OF THE HISTORY ONES. 

					SOMETHING ABOUT PLAGUES. 

					YOU LIKE PLAGUES.

		WALKER (W):		NO, I WANT SILENCE.

					I'M TRYING TO HEAR THE STREETLIGHTS.

		WALKER (R):		THAT'S NOT A REAL THING.

		WALKER (W):		YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.	

[5:4]

CAPTURE OF A WEATHER RADAR.

THE SATELLITE IS ZOOMED OUT OF THE US: A MASSIVE, LOOMING, DARK CLOUD APPROACHES. 

BROKEN WIND THROUGH THE STATIC.

[CUT TO:]

SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE OF WALKER SITTING UP IN A MOTEL BED. 	

THE TV GLOWS ON HIS FACE.

	TV:		[TAPE HISSING] [DISTANT STRINGS]
	
	WOMAN (V.0):	JOACHIM WAS NOT A PRIEST. NOT REALLY. NOT IN THE WAY WE THINK OF THEM NOW.

	(CONT'D):	HE WAS A SEER. A CARTOGRAPHER OF TIME.
	
	TV:		[STOCK LIGHTNING SOUND EFFECT]
	
[4:3]

BLUE SCREEN. SOME KIND OF OPERATING SYSTEM STARTS UP. SEVERAL BEEPS.

"MIRROR-OS [V. 0. 0.3]
INIT SYSTEM CORE...
MEMORY: OK
VOLUME: /body/memory (MOUNTED)
SHELL: 	/mirror/bin/ghost.sh
ENV:	[STABLE]"

A DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT. THE MOUSE CLICKS ON A PROGRAM THAT OPENS A WEBCAM, SHOWING WALKER. 

HE'S SITTING IN THE BACK OF HIS CAR, PARKED IN A PARKING LOT.

LIT BY THE INTERIOR LIGHTS OF HIS CAR. HE OPENS UP A PROGRAM CALLED "ECHO".

THE CHAT LOG FROM EARLIER POPS UP IN A WINDOW, EXCEPT NOW WITH A NEW, BLANK CHAT. HE SPEAKS:

	WALKER (W):	I THINK I PARKED TOO CLOSE TO THE CART RETURN.

	WALKER (R):	DON'T YOU ALWAYS?

	WALKER (W):	I THOUGHT... I THOUGHT THAT I'D FEEL DIFFERENT, ONCE I GOT HERE.

	WALKER (R):	BUT YOU DON'T.

	WALKER (W):	NO. IT'S WORSE.

	WALKER (R):	IT'S ALWAYS WORSE WHEN YOU STOP MOVING.

	WALKER (W):	I FEEL LIKE I'M FORGETTING SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

	WALKER (R):	WHAT KIND OF IMPORTANT?

	WALKER (W):	I DON'T KNOW...

	WALKER (W):	I HATE BEING OUT IN PUBLIC. (LOOKS AROUND) 

			ANYONE COULD BE HERE.

	WALKER (R):	NO ONE'S LOOKING AT YOU.

	WALKER (W):	YOU CAN'T KNOW THAT.

	WALKER (R):	YOU LOOKED, DIDN'T YOU?

	WALKER (W):	YEAH.

	WALKER (R):	AND?

	WALKER (W):	(LOOKS BACK) 

			THERE'S A GUY. SITTING TWO CARS OVER. LIGHTS OFF. HE'S JUST... SITTING THERE.

	WALKER (R):	AREN'T YOU DOING THAT TOO...?

	WALKER (W):	THIS IS DIFFERENT.

	WALKER (R):	IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.

	WALKER (W):	OR IT'S NOT.

			MAYBE HE'S WAITING FOR SOMETHING.

			MAYBE WE'RE BOTH WAITING FOR THE SAME THING.

	WALKER (R):	YOU'RE NOT HERE FOR THE SAME REASON.

	WALKER (W):	(LOOKS AROUND LIKE HE NOTICED SOMETHING)

			I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

			(CLOSES LAPTOP LID)

[9:16]

SCREEN RECORDING OF WALKER'S PHONE. LOCK SCREEN, SWIPE, HOME SCREEN.

HE PICKS THE CAMERA APP AND STARTS RECORDING HIMSELF.

HE NERVOUSLY WALKS INTO THE TARGET WHILE FILMING HIMSELF. 

HE KEEPS LOOKING AT THE CAMERA SCREEN AS IF HE WAS LOOKING AT HIMSELF, OR WHAT'S BEHIND HIM.

HE TURNS AROUND AND CHECKS BEHIND HIM TOO, REGARDLESS OF THE CAMERA.

HE BUYS A BASEBALL CAP, HOODIE, SUNGLASSES, A SMALL LED FLASHLIGHT, AA BATTERIES, AND DISPOSABLE GLOVES.

HE GOES BACK TO THE CAR.
