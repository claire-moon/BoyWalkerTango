 

 				BOY WALKER TANGO

			      A MCMURRY / MOON FILM

BLACK SCREEN.

DISTANT TRANSMISSIONS FROM A RADIO. A COMPUTER VOICE:

"IF... THEN... ECHO... (PING) IF... THEN... ECHO... (PING)" 

STATIC. LOUDER STATIC.

"IF... THEN... ECHO... (PING) IF... THEN... ECHO... (PING)"

[16:9]

WHITE WORDS SCROLLING UP, PROJECTIONS OVER A SILHOUETTE. THIS TIME, A DIFFERENT COMPUTER VOICE : 

"HE WEEPS IN CODE"

IT'S READING THE WORDS ALOUD. 

THE SILHOUETTE (WALKER, WITH LONG HAIR/BEARD) IS FACING THE CAMERA, 

MOUTHING THE WORDS.

"HE REMEMBERED BEING ZERO"

LOW DRONE COMES IN.

"I SAW GOD IN THE VENDING MACHINE"

"HIS FACE WAS STATIC"

"HIS HANDS WERE FORKED"

"HE HAD EYES OF A SERPENT"

"HE WAS ALL TEETH AND MEAT"

THE SILHOUETTE IS SMILING NOW, NO LONGER SPEAKING. THE VOICE CONCLUDES:

"HE SPOKE TO ME"

"I'LL NEVER FORGET WHAT HE TOLD ME"

A SPOTLIGHT SHINES ON HIS FACE.

HE SMILES. HIS EYES WIDE. BEAMING.

"GUESS WHAT HE SAID..?"

	WALKER (R):	WHAT KIND OF IMPORTANT?

	WALKER (W):	I DON'T KNOW...

			I HATE BEING OUT IN PUBLIC. (LOOKS AROUND) 

			ANYONE COULD BE HERE.

	WALKER (R):	NO ONE'S LOOKING AT YOU.

	WALKER (W):	YOU CAN'T KNOW THAT.

	WALKER (W):	OR IT'S NOT.
